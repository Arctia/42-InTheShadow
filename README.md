# 42 In The Shadow

"In this project, you will develop a game close to Shadowmatic, using a game engine of your choice. Here is the goal of the game: the player must use one or more objects in the foreground to create a shadow that looks like a familiar shape in the background."

### Tools
I'm going to use Godot 4, Blender and Krita.
